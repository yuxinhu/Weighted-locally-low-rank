# Weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) for low rank approximation

Low rankness of image/k-space data has been exploited in many different MRI applications. The weighted nuclear norm, or weighted summation of the eigenvalues of the matrix, can approximate the rank more accurately than the nuclear norm, and may therefore maintain the signal fidelity better while approaching low-rank approximation. 

Here we provide the implementation of WNNM based on [BART (version 0.4.03)](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/) for MRI reconstruction. This work has been published on [ISMRM 2020]('Hu_2020ISMRM_wLLR.pdf').
